# CommTester Project Log

This file records significant verified results, accepted decisions, checkpoints, and the immediate development state of CommTester.

## CHECKPOINT-19 — Modbus RTU Slave baseline

### CURRENT STATE

The compact portable CommTester is based on Arduino Nano / ATmega328P. The Modbus RTU Slave subsystem is operational and has reached a verified baseline.

### COMPLETED

The current Slave implementation successfully passed the following functional tests:

- FC01 — Read Coils
- FC02 — Read Discrete Inputs
- FC03 — Read Holding Registers, including addresses near the upper end of the configured 125-register area
- FC04 — Read Input Registers, including addresses near the upper end of the configured 125-register area
- FC05 — Write Single Coil
- FC06 — Write Single Holding Register
- FC15 — Write Multiple Coils
- FC16 — Write Multiple Holding Registers

Write operations were verified by reading the modified values back from the Slave.

CRC test:

- correct CRC frame — PASS;
- deliberately invalid CRC frame — PASS, frame rejected with no response.

RTU timing tests:

- normal frame — PASS;
- deliberate 3 ms, 5 ms and 10 ms inter-byte gaps — no response, which is the expected behavior for the performed gap test;
- t1.5 boundary experiment was performed from 1.40 ms through 1.70 ms. No response was observed in the tested boundary cases. The experiment is recorded as an observation, not as a general claim about all RTU implementations.

### DECISIONS

- Preserve the current Slave implementation as the working baseline.
- Do not modify the external `ModbusADU` library.
- Continue development with Modbus Master as the next major subsystem.
- Keep the compact tester separate from the larger diagnostic instrument planned for later.

### FACTS

The current automated test suite reports successful operation of all eight implemented Slave function codes: FC01, FC02, FC03, FC04, FC05, FC06, FC15 and FC16.

### OPEN QUESTIONS

- Final Master implementation and API.
- Master-side error handling and diagnostics.
- Resource budget for future display and statistics.

### NEXT STEP

M2 — establish and test the Modbus RTU Master baseline.

### BLOCKERS

None.
